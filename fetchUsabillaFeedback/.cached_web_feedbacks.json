Below are my comments on BODI used through Apple TV app. \n\n1. Apple TV app does not allow you to filter by Trainer. Please add this feature ASAP. \n2. It would be very helpful if instead of having the same generic description for each BODI Camp class, if it could specify that it was a lower body/upper body/ab /total bodyworkout. The 2 classes I've taken were mainly upper body focused and I found this frustrating because I was looking for a total body workout. \n3. Add a filter to be able to search by upper/total/lower body or ab workout within BODI classes. Obe has this feature and it lets you quickly find a targeted workout. \n4. Add a filter to be able to search by workout duration - 10 mins, 30 mins, 60 mins, etc. \n5. I used to have an Obe subscription and I still have a Kira Stokes fitness app subscription in conjunction with my BOD subscription. The main reason I keep Kira is because she has a wonderful Fine Tuning Section that I am obsessed with. All of these \"add on\" workouts are under 10 mins and they are great to do as either a warm up before my BOD workout or a little something extra when I'm finished. I would love to see BODI add a 10 minute section. Sample workouts could be 5 minute arms with 2 pound weights, quick ab blasts, or banded glute exercises. This added feature would elevate BODI to a new level of overall fitness. Everything is a full workout and sometimes it's fun to do 3 10 minute targeted workouts from the Fine Tuning section I mentioned in Kira Stokes app.\n6. I tried taking a cycling class yesterday that was Fall scenery through the Northeast. The wrong workout would come up when I clicked it - HIIT and Core. Please double check that workout. \n7. I love the scenic cycling classes. They are wonderful! Please add more!

Love the instructors (where has Lacee been??) and music is great.  However, there are a few changes that could really help the platform. First, it takes about 90 seconds to start a class between the ad and the request to do feedback. I've seen it every time and the 30 second countdown just adds to the wait. At one point, I clicked out altogether and went over to Obe and started a new class in less than 30 seconds.. Also, sometimes classes don't link to the right one (clicked on one for Jericho and Meghan came up). Wish you had a schedule to follow especially since you don't have classes in the early morning eastern time zone. Finally, the BODcast is just annoying. I really wish it were only the instructor. Most of the time they are delayed, I really don't need to see their kids and it's distracting.

As you work out the kinks, a few thoughts:\n\nThe most frustrating part of the platform is that the classes labeled live, aren't always live. I just did Autumn's Bodi Camp (10am Sunday), finding it under the live section. But I was super disappointed when the workout started and I realize I'd done it just a couple days earlier.  I wish you'd stop labeling those classes as live because it's very misleading. \n\nWhy aren't all \"new\" classes archived on the platform for users to take any time? Some classes are, but not all of them. Why? And how do you decide?\nI find the overall categorization of classes and finding the ones I want incredibly confusing. For example, it took me weeks to realize several booty and core classes are listed under strength, not the core section?  As a compromise, can you put it under both? Also, is there a way to find all of one trainer's classes listed clearly in one section? Users should be able to click on their favorite trainer and find all of their archived classes.\n\nAlso, I'm not always able to take a class that I sign up for. But it would be amazing if that specific class was presented to me under the \"recommendation\" section. The recommendations make no sense -- it just the same classes over and over. Nothing new. \n\nI absolutely loved Autumn's Off The Wall class -- I wish she did more of those! It was so wonderful to have a live version of that class. But in general, I find the Beachbody website to be nonsensical in the way search and discovery work. For example, I can't tell you how frustrating it is to find a recipe I know I've seen before, but can't figure out if it's portion fix, weekly fix or one of the many other verticals that Autumn has for recipes. I recently discovered-after years!- that sometimes you. have to click on a workout program like Control Freak and that's where the recipes are found. It's extremely confusing. They need to be in one place.\n\nThanks for the hard work!", "commentTranslated": "", "commentTranslatedFrom": "", "location": "", "browser": {"name": "Safari", "version": "14.0", "os": "MacOSX", "devicetype": "Desktop"}, "date": "2021-11-07T15:59:40.417Z", "custom": {"Platform": "roku", "do_we_have_permissio": "Yes", "first_name": "Tara", "issue_type": "bodi_other"}, "email": "tara.weiss@gmail.com", "image": "", "labels": [], "nps": 0, "publicUrl": null, "rating": 4, "buttonId": "1e457a7fb8ed", "tags": [], "url": "https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/bodi?locale=en_US", "Bucket": "u4w-screenshots-production"}, {"id": "6187f94568cd5d285978ccdf", "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.69 Safari/537.36", "comment": "I love the Bodi website.
